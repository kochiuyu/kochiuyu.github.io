Choose a hotel closet to the Head-Quarters (HQ) hotel but NOT in the HQ hotel. (because HQ hotel has too many people!) Aim to arrive at AEAs for Wednesday night or Thursday morning. Make hotel arrangements immediately as rooms get booked really quick  JOE: LOTS of openings  Look specifically at openings in  Within your field Any Fields: check with your network to see any insider information General Economics/Teaching  Check for late October/early November deadlines. Most are mid or late November or December.  Create an spread document to organize openings and their dead- lines. (share with your classmates!) Compile a list of schools you plan to apply Do NOT apply jobs not in your field or to places you would never go. This wastes your and others time and bad for your fellow class- mates. To aim too high or too low as other schools may know you are not making serious applications – Run the list with your advisors.   Get ready for your application material:  Check information of the schools you want to apply (You will need need it to mention it in your cover letter.) Upload your website (with JMP, photo, CV, research/teaching state- ments) Complete your CV Polish your research and teaching statements.

Other research papers only if well-polished and approved by your advi- sor 3–4 letters of recommendation. Perhaps a teaching letter as well. Your CV (modify the ordering of your research fields depending on the listed opening). Teaching evaluations (if academic). Teaching statement (if academic, particularly liberal arts schools). Research statement (summary of your papers, and your ongoing re- search) An unofficial or official graduate transcript (sometimes). Chinese CV (for chinese schools)  Keep your advisors/secretary posted on where to send e-mail, upload or mail reference letters. Let them know your deadlines.\n  December: Schedule and Prepare Interviews  December JOE: some relevant openings here but not as many as in the prior 2 months. Places start calling or e-mailing to set up interviews at the AEAs (before Christmas). Be polite (and sound happy they called!) and ask for the following informa- tion:  Institution 2. Person who called/e-mailed and their contact information. The name and contact information for the contact person at the AEA meetings. Day and time of the interview and hotel it will take place in. Disclosure code (this is the code you will get and look up online during the meetings to find out the exact room the interview takes place in). Other people who will be at the interview  Scheduling of interviews:  Act quickly! Good spots fill up quickly. o Put less important interviews on Thursday night or early Friday morn- ing as warm up. Put the most important ones at the times you are in the best shape! AT LEAST 15 minutes between interviews, especially for switching ho- tels. Look at a map when you are scheduling (Game is over if you are late for interview) Try to have a string of interviews in the same hotel. Try to leave a little bit of room for lunch if you can. If you do not have enough (less than 10) interviews, talk to your advi- sors.  Interview Preparation:  In late December, set up mock interviews with faculty members. Do 6-8 and mix and match faculty so that you have 2 faculty members in different fields. Prepare 2-, 5-, and 15-minute versions about your JMP!  Embed them into each other. Be flexible and be prepared to be derailed. Dont sounding like you are memorizing! No one like to talk to machine. 2-minute version: simple enough for people outside your field to understanding; give people a big picture; make your idea interesting to people outside your field 5-minute version: Go into greater details of what you are doing; you should tell how your work different from existing literature 15-minute version: Let the expert in your field to know what you are doing and let people outside you field to also feel that they know you are doing something seems interesting and useful Questions:  Have you submitted the paper? Where you are going to submit it? How you come up with this idea? Prepare to talk to other papers  What’s next in terms of research?  Teaching questions:  What classes can you teach? Which textbook you are going to use? What topics you are going to cover?  Do research on the school you are going to interview.  Why you would like to come to our place? Try to understand the research of the people who are in the inter- view  Get your suits ready:  2 suits, 4 shirts, 1 handbag and 2 good shoes.  Have a good hair cut     Early January: AEA Meetings!  If you followed the advice, you should have:  Booked a hotel that is very close to but not in the headquarters Arrive Wednesday night. (or before) Have 1-2 suits and comfortable shoes.  In your handbag, you should have  Snacks (energy bars) Some bottle of water. Bring change for paying cab drivers, so that you are not running around with a $100 bill unable to get change. Some copies of CV (especially for walk-in interviews for industry jobs)  During interview (usually 30-45 minutes)  Usually in a hotel room Talk about your JMP for 15-20 minutes Asked questions related to research and teaching for 5 to 10 minutes You are introduced with the institutions and place Last 2-5 minutes, you will be asked to ask questions.  Do have some good questions (dont ask question that you can an- swer from the website) You might ask research support, quality of students Tell them if your spouse/partner is also looking for academic jobs NEVER talk about salary    Mid-January through March: FLYOUT  If you passed interviews, you will get to visit the place. Scheduling flyout:  Try not to put the most important the first one. You should call the other nearby schools you have interviewed so that costs can be shared. You usually pay for transport and get reimbursed later but hotel is usually covered by the school. Keep all original receipts. Make copies and mail the originals. Never check your baggage! Bring a carry-on with your suits. A typical fly-out:  Arrive the afternoon/night before. Morning:  Someone may pick you up for an informal breakfast. When you arrive, you will be given a schedule with a list of people to meet. Most of time, you talk about your research. Some of the times, you listen their research or even something unrelated.  Lunch:  Usually at the faculty dining hall with a large number of faculty, and not many within your field.  Afternoon:  Job talk: usually 1.5 hrs, make sure that most people understand the first 30 minutes Meet more people The last one to meet is either the department chair or the Dean. – Dinner: Typically with the search committee and department head. A chance to show that you are good person to be colleague. Be relaxed, polite and engage in conversation during these dinners. – Some questions to ask during flyout:  What are the tenure requirements? What has the tenure success rate been in the last few years? Do you find the department to be collegial? Where would you recommend living? Is there any housing subsidy/allowance? Does the department do a good job of supporting new faculty? In terms of research support, mentorship, shielding from service duties, minimizing teaching preps, etc.? Living environments: Are there good schools nearby? Good restau- rants?    February-April: Flyout and Offers  Congratulation! You get an offer after 6-month search process!\n Most of offers are verbal. Written formal offers need to get to the administration so they take a lot of time. Offer always come with deadline. Usual case is two weeks. Ask other schools that you have done a flyout to see if they would also like to make you an offer before the deadline. Try to extend deadline for a few days if necessary but should avoid asking for too many days. Bargaining is usually ONLY possible if you have another offer. Make sure you dont bargain too hard. Make sure you are aware of allowance (education, housing, and medi- cal). Check if you are offered a standard package or not.

When you arrive, you will be given a schedule with a list of people to meet. Most of time, you talk about your research. Some of the times, you listen their research or even something unrelated.  Lunch:  Usually at the faculty dining hall with a large number of faculty, and not many within your field.  Afternoon:  Job talk: usually 1.5 hrs, make sure that most people understand the first 30 minutes Meet more people The last one to meet is either the department chair or the Dean. – Dinner: Typically with the search committee and department head. A chance to show that you are good person to be colleague. Be relaxed, polite and engage in conversation during these dinners. – Some questions to ask during flyout:  What are the tenure requirements? What has the tenure success rate been in the last few years? Do you find the department to be collegial? Where would you recommend living? Is there any housing subsidy/allowance? Does the department do a good job of supporting new faculty? In terms of research support, mentorship, shielding from service duties, minimizing teaching preps, etc.? Living environments: Are there good schools nearby? Good restau- rants?    February-April: Flyout and Offers  Congratulation! You get an offer after 6-month search process!\n Most of offers are verbal. Written formal offers need to get to the administration so they take a lot of time. Offer always come with deadline. Usual case is two weeks. Ask other schools that you have done a flyout to see if they would also like to make you an offer before the deadline. Try to extend deadline for a few days if necessary but should avoid asking for too many days. Bargaining is usually ONLY possible if you have another offer. Make sure you dont bargain too hard. Make sure you are aware of allowance (education, housing, and medi- cal). Check if you are offered a standard package or not.

Then you can see the code will be copied to the interactive console.\n\rAssignment\rThe left is assigned to the value on the right. For example, x - 15 implies that the value 15 is assigned to a variable called x. Note: Variables are case-sensitive.\nx \u0026lt;- 15\rx -1\r## [1] 14\r\rHello World\rTo print an output, simply use the function print()\nprint(\u0026#39;Hello Word!\u0026#39;)\r## [1] \u0026quot;Hello Word!\u0026quot;\rSometimes we would also want to display the value of a variable:\nx \u0026lt;- 4\ry \u0026lt;- 5\rz \u0026lt;- x+y\rprint(z)\r## [1] 9\rHowever, we want to print the description of the variable too.

It is converted from character data type. One complication is that we need to specify the format since there are a lot of possible way to express it.\nFor day, we use %d for day number (01-31).\nFor month, we use %m for month number (00-12), %b for abbreviated month (e.g. Jan), and %B for unabbreviated month (e.g. January)\nFor year, we use %y for two-digit year (e.g., 14) and %Y for four-digit year (e.g., 2014)\nas.Date(\u0026quot;21Jan2004\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;%d%b%Y\u0026quot;)\r## [1] \u0026quot;2004-01-21\u0026quot;\ras.Date(\u0026quot;21/01/04\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;%d/%m/%y\u0026quot;)\r## [1] \u0026quot;2004-01-21\u0026quot;\ras.Date(\u0026quot;21-01-04\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;%d-%m-%y\u0026quot;)\r## [1] \u0026quot;2004-01-21\u0026quot;\r\r\rData Structure\rIn R, you can use different types of data structures, depending on your needs:\nVector,\rMatrix,\rArray,\rDataframe, and\rList.\r\rThe type of data structure used generally differs by how information is stored and displayed, and also accessed or edited.\nVector\rVector is the most common and basic data structure in R.\nVector is simply data of the same data type ordered in a list.\nThe simplest vector is an integer vector. For a vector of integers from 1 to 5, we just need to use 1:5.\nx \u0026lt;- 1:5\rx\r## [1] 1 2 3 4 5\rSometimes, we want to repeat the same number several times. We use the function rep(). The following code repeat 0 five times.\nx \u0026lt;- rep(0, 5)\rx\r## [1] 0 0 0 0 0\rThis is usually a good way to initialize a vector. Slightly more general way to create a vector of integer is to use seq().\nFor integers from 4 to 10 with each step being 2, we have ``seq(4,10,by=2)’’. If the step is negative, then it is decreasing.\nx \u0026lt;- seq(4,10,by=2)\rx\r## [1] 4 6 8 10\rx \u0026lt;- seq(21,6,by=-3)\rx\r## [1] 21 18 15 12 9 6\rTo create a generic vector, we use the function c().

They are extremely useful because if we have to make a particular calculation multiple times, we can just program a function and reuse it in the future. For example, sum is a function that takes in inputs of numbers, and returns the value of all the numbers added together.\nDefining a function\rThe most basic function is a function that has does not return any value.\nHello\u0026lt;- function (...) {\rcat(\u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;)\r}\rHello()\r## Hello World\rNow, we define a function called myadd that adds 2 input numbers together and returns the total value.\nmyadd \u0026lt;- function (x, y) {\rreturn(x+y)\r}\rmyadd(3, 4)\r## [1] 7\rFrom the example, we can see that a function consists of 2 parts, the 1st being the inputs, and the 2nd being the body of the function. When you define a function, you need to specify how many inputs the function requires. How you name them is up to you, but it is likely you will need to use the names of the inputs in the body of the function. The body of the function is where you write the code for what you want the function to do with the inputs. Do not forget to include a return statement, otherwise there will be no output shown in the console for the function.\nWe can also set default value of a function:\nmyadd \u0026lt;- function (x, y=1) {\rreturn(x+y)\r}\rmyadd(3)\r## [1] 4\rmyadd(3, 4)\r## [1] 7\rNow also that since R is a vectorized program, function can take vector as imputs:\nmyadd \u0026lt;- function (x, y) {\rreturn(x+y)\r}\rmyadd(1:3, 3:5)\r## [1] 4 6 8\r\rExercise\rWrite the following function:\n\rtake three numerical numbers\rcalculate the product of three numerical inputs\rdisplay the value\rreturn the value as function output\r\r\rAssignment of function outputs\rYou can also store the output of a function into another variable, by assigning the output to that variable.\nFor example, result stores the value of add(3,4), which is 7. When you call result, you will then get the value 7.\nresult \u0026lt;- myadd(3, 4)\rresult \r## [1] 7\r\rHelp on function\rType a function’s name at the console, you can see the code behind. If you Type “? function’s name”, you will see its help file as in Figure 1.\n? sum\r\rFigure 1: Help content for sum in RStudio\r\r\rSource code of a function\rIf you type the function name without bracket, then it will show the code of the function.\nmyadd \u0026lt;- function (x, y) {\rreturn(x+y)\r}\rmyadd\r## function (x, y) {\r## return(x+y)\r## }\r\r\rFinancial Data\rFinancial data are usually time series. Data are often indexed by date and even time. Date are usually converted from character data type using functionas.Date() whiel date-time data are converted using function as.POSIXct().\nWithout time, the program will put in hours.\nas.POSIXct(\u0026quot;03-12-2014\u0026quot;,format=\u0026quot;%d-%m-%Y\u0026quot;)\r## [1] \u0026quot;2014-12-03 +08\u0026quot;\rThe package xts is useful to handle financial data.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;xts\u0026quot;)\rlibrary(xts)\rCreate an xts object using the xts() function:\ndates\u0026lt;-as.Date(c(\u0026quot;2016-01-01\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;2016-01-02\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;2016-01-03\u0026quot;))\rprices \u0026lt;- c(1.1,2.2,3.3)\rx \u0026lt;- xts(prices, order.by=dates)\rEach observation has time timestamp.\nx[1]\r## [,1]\r## 2016-01-01 1.1\rIt is often more useful to be more specific about timing instead of number of row.

Instead we need to use x-lag(x)\nTo transfer timestamp to another vector, we use reclass(). The following code copy the timestamp from x to y:\ny \u0026lt;- c(1,0,-1)\ry \u0026lt;- reclass(y,x)\ry\r## [,1]\r## 2016-01-01 1\r## 2016-01-02 0\r## 2016-01-03 -1\rTwo xts objects with the same timestamps can be combined using cbind()\nz \u0026lt;- cbind(x,y)\rz\r## x y\r## 2016-01-01 1.1 1\r## 2016-01-02 2.2 0\r## 2016-01-03 3.3 -1\rSometimes, some entries in the data are missing and there will be calculation problems for time series calculation (e.g. lag operator Lag()). There are using two ways to deal with the problem:\nna.omit() to take away those data points, and\rna.approx() to to take linear approximation.\r\rNote that na.approx() is only available (and also only meaningful) for time series data.\n\rData Management\rWe first cover data format conversion since sometimes the data is not in the right format. Second, we will learn how to load a built-in dataset to illustrate how to take a snapshot of the data, sorting the data, selecting observation, selecting variable, subseting the dataset, and merging dataframes. Then we will learn two useful packages: dplyr and reshape.

For example, we often ask if a variable x is bigger than a certain number?\nA more sophiciated way is to combine two simple logical statements using logical operators.\nRelational Operators\rIt compares two numerical expressions and return a Boolean variable: either 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE). The following table shows the six commonly used relational operators\n\r\rRelational operator\rInterpretation\r\r\r\r\u0026lt;\rless than\r\r\u0026lt;=\rless than or equal to\r\r\u0026gt;\rgreater than\r\r\u0026gt;=\rgreater than or equal to\r\r==\requal to\r\r!=\rnot equal to\r\r\r\rPrecedence of relational operators is lower than arithmetic operators. To avoid confusion, it is good practice to use brackets to control ordering. For example, if we write 2 + 2 1 + 3, then the software we do the arithmetic operators first. This implies we have 4 4, which implies a false statement\n\rLogical Operators\rIn practice, we often use two or more conditions to decide what to do. For example, scholarship is often given if the candidate has done well in both academic and extra-curricular activities.\nTo combine different conditions, there are three logical operators: (1) \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, (2) ||, and (3) !.\nFirst, \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is similar to AND in English, that is, A \u0026amp;\u0026amp; B is true only if both A and B are true. Second, is similar to OR in English, that is, A || B is false only if both A and B are false. Third, ! is similar to NOT in English, that is, !A is true only if A is false.\n\r\rA\rB\rA \u0026amp;\u0026amp; B\rA || B\r!A\r!B\r\r\r\rfalse\rfalse\rfalse\rfalse\rtrue\rtrue\r\rfalse\rtrue\rfalse\rtrue\rtrue\rfalse\r\rtrue\rfalse\rfalse\rtrue\rfalse\rtrue\r\rtrue\rtrue\rtrue\rtrue\rfalse\rfalse\r\r\r\rDifferent relational operators, the precedence of logical operators can be high. While and and or operators are lower in precedence than relational operators, not has a very high precedence and almost always evaluated first. - Hence, it is always a good practice to use brackets to control operation ordering.\n\r\rConditional\rPerform a different set of statement(s) based on whether the condition is true or false.\nif (condition){\rblocks to execute when condition hold\r} else{\rblocks to execuse when condition fails\r}\rExample of if-else statement\nx \u0026lt;- 1\ry \u0026lt;- 2\rif(x \u0026lt; y){print(\u0026quot;Yes!\u0026quot;)}\r## [1] \u0026quot;Yes!\u0026quot;\rif(x\u0026lt;y){\rprint(\u0026quot;Yes!\u0026quot;)\r} else{\rprint(\u0026quot;No~\u0026quot;)\r}\r## [1] \u0026quot;Yes!\u0026quot;\rExercises\rWrite a function f(x) that returns absolute value of x.\n\rIf x is positive, then f(x) =x.\n\rIf x is negative, then f(x) = -x.\n\r\rWrite a function f(x) that returns CAP given exam score x.\n\rIf x=90, then CAP is 5.\n\rIf x is between 80 and 90, then CAP is 4.\n\rIf x is between 70 and 80, then CAP is 3.\n\rIf x is less than 70, then CAP is 2.\n\r\rWrite a function f(x,y) that returns grade using test score x and exam score y.\r\rIf x+y is no less than 90 and y is no less than 40, then grade is A+.\rIf x+y is no less than 80 but less than 90, then CAP is A.\rIf x+y is no less than 70 but less than 80, then CAP is A-.\rIf x+y is less than 70, then CAP is B+.\r\r\r\rApplication: Checking Data Type\rOne important usage of conditional statement is to check whether the data for calculation is correct.\nVery often, we only want to execute the code if the data point exists. We can use is.na(). It will return true if it is NA; otherwise false.\nif(!is.na(x)){\rdo.something\r}\rAnother related function is to check if the data type is number. The function is.numeric() returns true if it is numerical variable; otherwise false.\n\rApplication: Missing data\rNote that R reports error if there is an NA in the statement.\nx \u0026lt;- NA\rx \u0026gt; 0\r## [1] NA\rVery often, we want to set ignore those case with missing data (NA). Then we will use isTRUE\nx \u0026lt;- NA\risTRUE(x \u0026gt; 0)\r## [1] FALSE\r\r\rLoop\rWe very often want to execute codes multiple times with the same or similar conditions. There are two basic forms of repetition statement in R:\nWhile loop: repeat as long as condition is true,\rfor loop over integers: repeat for a pre-specific number of times, and\rfor loop over vector.\r\rWhile loop\rThe syntax of while loop is as follows:\nwhile (condition){\rkeep doing when condition holds\r}\rThe following example shows how to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 10.\nn \u0026lt;- 10\ri \u0026lt;- 1\rsum \u0026lt;- 0\rwhile (i \u0026lt;= n){ # i is the control variable sum \u0026lt;- sum + i # accumulate i into sum\ri \u0026lt;- i + 1 # increment i by 1\r}\r\rFor Loop over integers\rLoops that are based on the value of an integer variable. It increases by the same amount each time, and ends when the variable reaches a specified value\nThe syntax for a for loop is simple.\nm \u0026lt;- 1\rn \u0026lt;-10\rfor (i in m:n){\rrun as long as condition holds\r}\r\rLoop over vectors\rWe can define a vector and construct a for loop that executes for each element in the vector:\nstudents \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Amy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Tom\u0026quot;)\rfor (student in students){\rcat(student,\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)\r}\r## Amy ## Tom\r\rExample: Technical Indicators\rA n-day simple moving avaerage (n-day SMA) is arithmetic average of prices of past n days:\n\\[ SMA_t(n) = \\frac{P_t+\\ldots+P_{t-n+1}}{n}\\]\nThe following is an sMA function:\nmySMA \u0026lt;- function (price,n){\rsma \u0026lt;- c()\rsma[1:(n-1)] \u0026lt;- NA\rfor (i in n:length(price)){\rsma[i]\u0026lt;-mean(price[(i-n+1):i])\r}\rreturn(sma)\r}\rmySMA(1:10,5)\r## [1] NA NA NA NA 3 4 5 6 7 8\rAn n-day exponential moving avaerage (n-day EMA) is exponential average of prices where weighting of more recent prices carry higher weights.

The most useful for our purposes are:\napply(),\rsapply(), and\rlapply().\r\rapply\rWe will to apply a function to each row or each column on a matrix.

Very often, we need to download a lot of csv files from the website. Luckily csv files are stored on the website with structured url paths.\nFor example, suppose that we want to download the all historical weather data of Singapore airport. We go to the website http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/. Then we can see from the bottom that the links for download csv file is http://www.weather.gov.sg/files/dailydata/DAILYDATA_S24_201712.csv.\nHence, we will use getURL to get the file and the use textConnection to read the csv file directly.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;RCurl\u0026quot;)\rlibrary(RCurl)\rlink\u0026lt;-paste0(\u0026quot;http://www.weather.gov.sg/files/\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;dailydata/DAILYDATA_S24_201712.csv\u0026quot;)\rx \u0026lt;- getURL(URL)\rdf\u0026lt;-read.csv(textConnection(x))\rHowever, very often, we want to download more months. Then we can use loop. By guessing and checking, we know that S24 refers to Changi airport, 2017 is the year and 12 is December. To download the whole year of data, then we have to download all 12-month data, and at each time the link dynamically changes and the data is combined each round:\nsite\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;http://www.weather.gov.sg/files/dailydata/\u0026quot;\rmonths \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;01\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;02\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;03\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;04\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;05\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;06\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;07\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;08\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;09\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;10\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;11\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;12\u0026quot;)\rdf \u0026lt;-data.frame()\rfor (month in months){\rfilename \u0026lt;-paste0(\u0026quot;DAILYDATA_S24_2017\u0026quot;,month,\u0026quot;.csv\u0026quot;)\rlink\u0026lt;-paste0(site,filename)\rx \u0026lt;- getURL(link)\rtemp\u0026lt;-read.csv(textConnection(x))\rdf \u0026lt;-rbind(df,temp)\r}\rAlternatively, we can download each months as a separate csv file into a single folder and then combine all csv files at the end. This is particularly useful when the csv files are huge.\nThe following codes first download all the csv files into a temp folder and then combine all csv files in that folder. To combine all csv files in the folder, we need to obtain the path of all files using list.file'' where the optionfull.names’‘is set to be TRUE to also get the directory path. Then we need to have a list of csv files by using lapply with the import function fread.

rules based on day trading:\nbuy signal based on simple filter rule\rbuy and sell signals based on simple filter rule\rbuy signal based on RSI\rbuy signal based on EMA and sell signal based on RSI\rbuy signal based on RSI but trading size depends on price history\r\rFinally, we consider the rule that does non-day trading. In this case, we need to keep track of both cash and stock holdings.\nSimple filter Buy\rHere we create trading signal based on simple filter rule.

After loading all the packages, we initialize are variables and then download data.\nThen we need to get the data and define initial variables.Download using getSybmols()\noptions(\u0026quot;getSymbols.warning4.0\u0026quot;=FALSE)\rfrom =\u0026quot;2003-01-01\u0026quot;\rto =\u0026quot;2012-12-31\u0026quot;\rsymbols = c(\u0026quot;MSFT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IBM\u0026quot;)\rgetSymbols(symbols, from=from, to=to, adjust=TRUE)\rCurrency is USD for US stocks and the multiplier is always 1 for stocks.\ncurrency(\u0026quot;USD\u0026quot;)\rstock(symbols, currency=\u0026quot;USD\u0026quot;, multiplier=1)\rWe first define our strategy, portfolio and account name.\nstrategy.st \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;\rportfolio.st \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;\raccount.st \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;\rRemove any old variables\nrm.strat(\u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;)\rAfter naming strategy, portfolio and account, we initialize them:\ninitEq=100000\rinitDate=\u0026quot;1990-01-01\u0026quot;\rinitPortf(name=portfolio.st, symbols=symbols, initDate=initDate, currency=\u0026#39;USD\u0026#39;)\rinitAcct(name=account.st, portfolios=portfolio.st, initDate=initDate, currency=\u0026#39;USD\u0026#39;, initEq=initEq)\rinitOrders(portfolio=portfolio.st, symbols=symbols,\rinitDate=initDate)\rstrategy(strategy.st, store=TRUE)\r\rStep 2: Define indicator\rIndicator is just a function based on price. Since simple filter is not a standard technical indicator, we need to define it first.\nfilter \u0026lt;- function(price) {\rlagprice \u0026lt;- lag(price,1)\rtemp\u0026lt;-price/lagprice - 1\rcolnames(temp) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;\rreturn(temp)\r} \rWe add the simple filter as an indicator. Here the name is the indicator function we have defined. We need to specify what data to be used by the indicator. Since we have defined that the simple filter rule takes price as input, we need to tell the problem we are using the closing price. Note that the label filter is the variable assigned to this indicator, which implies it must be unique.\nadd.indicator(\rstrategy=strategy.st,\rname = \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;, arguments = list(price = quote(Cl(mktdata))), label= \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;)\rTo check if the indicator is defined correctly, use applyindicators to see if it works. The function try() is to allow the program continue to run even if there is an error.\ntest \u0026lt;-try(applyIndicators(strategy.st, mktdata=OHLC(AAPL)))\rhead(test, n=4)\r\rStep 3: Trading Signals\rTrading signals is generated from the trading indicators. For example, simple trading rule dictates that there is a buy signal when the filter exceeds certain threshold.\nIn quantstrat, there are three ways one can use a signal. It is refer to as name:\nsigThreshold: more or less than a fixed value\rsigCrossover: when two signals cross over\rsigComparsion: compare two signals\r\rThe column refers to the data for calculation of signal. There are five possible relationship:\ngt = greater than\rgte = greater than or equal to\rlt = less than\rlte = less than or equal to\req = equal to\r\rBuy Signal under simple trading rule with threshold \\(\\delta=0.05\\)\n# enter when filter \u0026gt; 1+\\delta\radd.signal(strategy.st, name=\u0026quot;sigThreshold\u0026quot;,\rarguments = list(threshold=0.05, column=\u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;,\rrelationship=\u0026quot;gt\u0026quot;, cross=TRUE),\rlabel=\u0026quot;filter.buy\u0026quot;)\rSell Signal under simple trading rule with threshold \\(\\delta=-0.05\\)\n# exit when filter \u0026lt; 1-delta\radd.signal(strategy.st, name=\u0026quot;sigThreshold\u0026quot;,\rarguments = list(threshold=-0.05, column=\u0026quot;filter\u0026quot;,\rrelationship=\u0026quot;lt\u0026quot;,\rcross=TRUE),\rlabel=\u0026quot;filter.sell\u0026quot;) \r\rStep 4. Trading Rules\rWhile trading signals tell us buy or sell, but it does not specify the execution details.\nTrading rules will specify the following seven elements:\nSigCol: Name of Signal\rSigVal: implement when there is signal (or reverse)\rOrdertype: market, stoplimit\rOrderside: long, short\rPricemethod: market\rReplace: whether to replace other others\rType: enter or exit the order\r\rBuy rule specifies that when a buy signal appears, place a buy market order with quantity size.\nadd.rule(strategy.st, name=\u0026#39;ruleSignal\u0026#39;, arguments = list(sigcol=\u0026quot;filter.buy\u0026quot;, sigval=TRUE, orderqty=1000,\rordertype=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;, orderside=\u0026#39;long\u0026#39;,\rpricemethod=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;,\rreplace=FALSE), type=\u0026#39;enter\u0026#39;, path.dep=TRUE)\rSell rule specifies that when a sell signal appears, place a sell market order with quantity size.\nadd.rule(strategy.st, name=\u0026#39;ruleSignal\u0026#39;, arguments = list(sigcol=\u0026quot;filter.sell\u0026quot;,\rsigval=TRUE, orderqty=-1000, ordertype=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;, orderside=\u0026#39;long\u0026#39;, pricemethod=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;, replace=FALSE), type=\u0026#39;enter\u0026#39;, path.dep=TRUE) \r\rStep 5. Evaluation Results\rWe will apply the our trading strategy, and the we update the portfolio, account and equity.\nout\u0026lt;-try(applyStrategy(strategy=strategy.st,\rportfolios=portfolio.st))\r##

Here, the argument is different from simple trading rule. For the SMA function, we need to tell the price vector and the number of period.\nadd.indicator(\rstrategy.st, name=\u0026quot;SMA\u0026quot;,\rarguments=list(x=quote(Cl(mktdata)), n=30),\rlabel=\u0026quot;sma30\u0026quot;)\radd.indicator(\rstrategy.st, name=\u0026quot;SMA\u0026quot;,\rarguments=list(x=quote(Cl(mktdata)), n=200),\rlabel=\u0026quot;sma200\u0026quot;)\r\rStep 3: Signals\rNow we add two signals: Buy signal appears when SMA30 is greater than SMA200. Sell signals appears when SMA30 is less than SMA200. Hence, this is different from simple trading rule.\nHere, we are going to do signal comparison so that we set name to sigComparison. We will compare two signals: sma30 and sma200. Then the relationship is greater than for buy and less than for less. We name the former to be a buy signal and the latter for a sell signal.\n# Bull market if SMA30\u0026gt;SMA200\radd.signal(\rstrategy.st, name=\u0026quot;sigComparison\u0026quot;,\rarguments=list(columns=c(\u0026quot;sma30\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;sma200\u0026quot;),\rrelationship=\u0026quot;gt\u0026quot;),\rlabel=\u0026quot;buy\u0026quot;)\r# Sell market if SMA30\u0026lt;SMA200\radd.signal(\rstrategy.st, name=\u0026quot;sigComparison\u0026quot;,\rarguments=list(columns=c(\u0026quot;sma30\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;sma200\u0026quot;), relationship=\u0026quot;lt\u0026quot;), label=\u0026quot;sell\u0026quot;)\rNote that here we use SigComparsion instead of SigCrossover. It is because SigComparsion will generate signals all the time but SigCrossover will generate signal only at cross.\n\rStep 4: Rules\rWe will consider buy and sell rules using market order. Note that we sell everything when sell signal arise. Hence, the order quantity is all and the type is exit.\n# Buy Rule\radd.rule(strategy.st, name=\u0026#39;ruleSignal\u0026#39;, arguments = list(sigcol=\u0026quot;buy\u0026quot;, sigval=TRUE, orderqty=1000, ordertype=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;, orderside=\u0026#39;long\u0026#39;, pricemethod=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;, replace=FALSE), type=\u0026#39;enter\u0026#39;, path.dep=TRUE)\r# Sell Rule\radd.rule(strategy.st, name=\u0026#39;ruleSignal\u0026#39;, arguments = list(sigcol=\u0026quot;sell\u0026quot;, sigval=TRUE, orderqty=\u0026#39;all\u0026#39;, ordertype=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;, orderside=\u0026#39;long\u0026#39;, pricemethod=\u0026#39;market\u0026#39;, replace=FALSE), type=\u0026#39;exit\u0026#39;, path.dep=TRUE) \r\rStep 5: Evaluation\rWe first try to apply the trading rule.\nout\u0026lt;-try(applyStrategy(strategy.st, portfolios=portfolio.st))\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-17 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 199.755777809092\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-18 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 194.1104863151\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-19 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 192.517452197251\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-22 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 193.552913521349\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-23 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 190.416645336717\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-24 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 189.888955759662\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-25 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 190.765126217072\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-26 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 192.42784735108\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-31 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 193.682352036262\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-01 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 196.290930643838\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-02 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 192.58713921341\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-05 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 193.294051426163\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-06 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 194.220007\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-07 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 191.160004\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-08 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 190.100006\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-09 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 189.639999\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-12 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 189.25\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-13 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 188.320007\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-14 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 185.509995\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-15 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 185.850006\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-16 08:00:00 IBM 1000 @ 186.940002\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-11-19 08:00:00 IBM -21000 @ 190.350006\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-17 08:00:00 MSFT 1000 @ 29.3488341516242\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-18 08:00:00 MSFT 1000 @ 29.2595676739748\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-19 08:00:00 MSFT 1000 @ 28.4065758956973\u0026quot;\r## [1] \u0026quot;2012-10-22 08:00:00 MSFT -3000 @ 27.7717930464845\u0026quot;\rThen we can update the accounts.\nupdatePortf(portfolio.st)\rupdateAcct(portfolio.st)\rupdateEndEq(account.st)\rWe can also plot the trading positions.\nfor(symbol in symbols) {\rchart.Posn(Portfolio=portfolio.st,\rSymbol=symbol,log=TRUE)\r}\r\r\rSMA rule with volatility filter\rWe will consider the following rule:\n\rBuy every day when\r\rSMA30 SMA200 and\r52 period standard deviation of close prices is less than its median over the last N periods.\r\rSell everything when\r\rSMA30 SMA200\r\r\rStep 1: Initialization\rWe first download data\nfrom =\u0026quot;2009-01-01\u0026quot;\rto =\u0026quot;2012-12-31\u0026quot;\rsymbols = c(\u0026quot;IBM\u0026quot;)\rcurrency(\u0026quot;USD\u0026quot;)\rgetSymbols(symbols, from=from, to=to, adjust=TRUE)\rstock(symbols, currency=\u0026quot;USD\u0026quot;, multiplier=1)\rinitEq=10^6\rWe first initialize the setup.\nstrategy.st \u0026lt;- portfolio.st \u0026lt;- account.st \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;SMAv\u0026quot;\rrm.strat(\u0026quot;SMAv\u0026quot;)\rinitPortf(portfolio.st, symbols=symbols,\rinitDate=initDate, currency=\u0026#39;USD\u0026#39;)\rinitAcct(account.st, portfolios=portfolio.st, initDate=initDate, currency=\u0026#39;USD\u0026#39;,\rinitEq=initEq)\rinitOrders(portfolio.st, initDate=initDate)\rstrategy(strategy.st, store=TRUE)\r\rStep 2: Indicator\rBesides SMA, we will need a new indicator to give buy signal.

One main feature is vector program language like Matlab. It is initially written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (hence the name of the software). Currently, it is a free open source software maintained by several contributors.\nCompared to alternatives, SAS, Matlab or Stata, R is completely free. Another benefit is that it is open source. This means that there is no black box for everything you use. You know what you are doing. It is also freely expendable so that you can do what you want to do.\nRStudio is an integrated development editor (IDE) for R. It is easier to write code using the editor.\nDownload We first cover how to download R and RStudio. Then we will study the basic interface for RStudio.\nDownload R Head to http://cran.r-project.org/ to download R. On the top of the page, you should see this. Choose the option based on your operating system.\n Figure 1. Download R: Choosing operating system   For example, if you choose the option for Windows, you will then see this. Click on the option install R for the first time.\n Figure 2. Download R   You will then reach this page. Click on the link to download R version 3.3.3. The download should then start.\n Figure 3. Download R for Windows   For Mac OS, clicking on the option for Mac brings you to this page. Click on the link in the red box to download R for Mac. The download should start when you click the link.\n Figure 4. Download R for Mac   Using RStduio Opening RStudio, you should see something as in Figure 5.\n Figure 5. RStudio Interface   As in Figure 6, there are 2 places where you can enter your code, as highlighted in red.\n Figure 6. RStudio Interface Left   The top part is called the code editor, where you can type your code, and choose to run it after you finish typing all of it.\nYou can also type your code in the console, which is below the code editor.\nIn the console, seeing the \u0026gt; symbol means that you are writing a new line of code. You can use the console for calculations, but for coding it is recommended you use the code editor if you wish to edit or reuse the code in future.\nAs in Figure 7, on the top right hand side, you will see a window called Global Environment. This is where all your data(downloaded data, assigned vectors etc) will be shown. Clicking on a data name in this part will open up the data.\n Figure 7. RStudio Interface Top Right   You can also view your history of past commands in the History tab.\nAs in Figure 8, at the bottom right hand side, you see this window which shows you the files, viewer, packages, and also the help window.\n Figure 8. RStudio Interface Bottom Right   For this course, we will mainly be using this to view plots/graphs, which will be displayed here when you run the code to generate the graphs.\n","date":1536422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536422400,"objectID":"ed93e721b848956aae2d4d52f3391f54","permalink":"/r/installation/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/r/installation/","section":"r","summary":"Learning Objectives:\n What is R?

Why LaTeX? What is TikZ? Installation of LaTeX Hello world  What is LaTeX? Why LaTeX? LaTeX is a markup language to write documents.

This manes that\n No need to bother with formatting, LaTeX will do it for you Easy to include math/graphics/tables  Therefore, it becomes a standard for academic publishing.\nWhat is TikZ? TikZ is the package in LaTeX that allows drawing of nice diagram. See the following exmaple:\n Demand and Supply   How to generate this graphic? By the following code:\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6] \\draw[thick,\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;] (0,10) node[above]{$P$}--(0,0)--(10,0) node[right]{$Q$}; \\node [below left] at (0,0) {$0$}; \\node [below] at (5,0) {$Q^*$}; \\node [left] at (0,5) {$P^*$}; \\draw(1,1)--(9,9) node[right]{$S$}; \\draw(1,9)--(9,1) node[right]{$D$}; \\draw[dashed](0,5)--(5,5)--(5,0); \\end{tikzpicture}  Installation of LaTeX Which software to install depends on your operation system:\n If you use windows system, you need to install MikTeX. If you use mac system, you need to install MacTeX.  Windows For Windows, go to MikTeX. You will then see the following at the top of the page.\n  Clicking the download button will then bring you to this page.\n  Download MiKTeX, then install and open TexWork. You are then ready to use LaTeX on your Windows computer.\nMac For Mac users, head to MacTeX. Click on the download MacTex button, as shown below.\n  LaTeX Hello World Since we are producing a document, we start to tell the program so by using the command \\documentclass{article}. Then we need to tell which section should be included in the output file by using \\begin{document} and \\end{document}.\nFinally, type the words “Hello World!” between the \\begin{document} and \\end{document}. Whatever text, pictures, or tables is included in between the 2 commands will appear on the document itself, and you can see this on the right-hand side.\n\\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} Hello World! \\end{document}  If you compile the file, you should get the following pdf output:\n  Front Matter Usually a document would start with a title. We just need to tell the program by \\title{}.\nSimilarly, we will usually have author after title. We only need to say \\author{}\nMoreover, we often put a time stamp to the document. To do so, we use \\date{}. Often we use \\today to represent the date to set this up.\nFinally, we need to tell the program where to put these information by using \\maketitle.\nAn example is as follows:\n\\documentclass{article} \\title{My important paper} \\author{VVIP} \\date{\\today} \\begin{document} \\maketitle Hello World! \\end{document}  Sectioning Next, we move on to sections and subsections. This is important if you wish to divide your text into nice, separate sections for readability.\nWhen you include sections by using \\section{}, LaTex automatically numbers each section for you. You might have seen this in academic papers, this is why people use LaTex when writing their papers. Subsections will take on that particular section’s number, and then include a second number behind to indicate that it is a subsection. We use \\subsection{} here. You can also use \\subsubsection{} if you wish.\nYou code will look like this:\n\\documentclass{article} \\title{My important paper} \\author{VVIP} \\date{\\today} \\begin{document} \\maketitle Hello World! \\section{Introduction} This is my best paper \\section{Model} We will have a lot of math. \\subsection{Basic Model} Math here is simplier. \\subsection{Full Model} Math here is crazy. \\section{Conclusion} My paper is great! \\end{document}  Appendix Appendix is another section that does not following numeric numbering (but alphabetical ordering). We just need to say \\appendix where the appendix starts.\n\\documentclass{article} \\title{My important paper} \\author{VVIP} \\date{\\today} \\begin{document} \\maketitle Hello World! \\section{Introduction} This is my best paper \\section{Model} We will have a lot of math. ... \\section{Conclusion} My paper is great! \\appendix \\section{Data Description} Here is the appendix. \\end{document}  Lists Undered lists are enclosed by \\begin{itemize} and \\end{itemize} and we use \\item to tell it is an item. A typical example is:\n\\begin{itemize} \\item I have an apple. \\item You have an orange. \\end{itemize}  Likewise, the \\begin{enumerate} and \\end{enumerate} also works the same way, and we also use \\item to create items. The only difference is that enumerate uses numbers, and itemize uses bullet points.\n\\begin{enumerate} \\item I have an apple. \\item You have an orange. \\end{enumerate}  Table Tables are created using the \\begin{tabular}{} and \\end{tabular} format. We can specify what type of table we want, and LaTex will create it for us.\n   Input Meaning     l left-justified column   c centered column   r right-justified column    An example is\n\\begin{tabular}{l c r} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 3 \\\\ \\hline 40 \u0026amp; 50 \u0026amp; 60 \\\\ 700 \u0026amp; 800 \u0026amp; 900 \\\\ \\end{tabular}  In the example above, we have used “l c r”, so LaTex creates a table with 3 columns, with the corresponding directional justifications.\nGraphics To include graphics files (e.g., jpg and png) in the document, we need to make use of the graphicx package, which is done by using \\usepackage{graphicx}. Note that package has to put before \\begin{document}.\nTo include a graphic file, we use the command \\includegraphics{filename}. Note that the file has to be in the same file as the tex file for this code to work.\nMathematics Mathematics is one of the main reasons to use LaTeX over other word processors. To let the program know that you are working on math, enclose your expression with dollar sign $:\n$ 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$  If we want a display equation, simply use double dollar sign $$:\n$$ 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$$  Page Margin The geometry package allows you to change the margins of the page, if you wish to.\n\\usepackage{geometry}  To change the individual sides’ margins, simply use \\geometry{margin=1.1in}. Take note that this should be put before the \\begin{document} since it is for the whole document. For example, we have\n\\usepackage{geometry} \\geometry{maring=1.1in}  To specify margins on four sides, we use \\geometry{left=2.5in, right=2.5in, top=2.5in, bottom=2.5in}\nLine spacing The setspace package allows you to edit the line spacing between each line, similar to Word’s function. Options include \\singlespacing, \\onehalfspacing, \\doublespacing.\n\\usepackage{setspace} \\singlespacing  TikZ Loading Package To load the TikZ package, we just need to use the function \\usepackage{tikz}\n\\documentclass{article} \\usepacakage{tikz} \\begin{document} Hello World! \\end{document}  Drawing your first TikZ diagram First, we need to tell which part of code should be included in the drawing by using \\begin{tikzpicture} and \\end{tikzpiture}.\nThen we can draw what we want. Here is an example code that gives us the demand and supply diagram above:\n\\documentclass{article} \\usepacakage{tikz} \\begin{document} \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6] \\draw[thick,\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;] (0,10) node[above]{$P$}--(0,0)--(10,0) node[right]{$Q$}; \\node [below left] at (0,0) {$0$}; \\node [below] at (5,0) {$Q^*$}; \\node [left] at (0,5) {$P^*$}; \\draw(1,1)--(9,9) node[right]{$S$}; \\draw(1,9)--(9,1) node[right]{$D$}; \\draw[dashed](0,5)--(5,5)--(5,0); \\end{tikzpicture} \\end{document}  ","date":1536422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536422400,"objectID":"1b0214133ab065b5eeadf8dd0f056816","permalink":"/tikz/introduction/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/tikz/introduction/","section":"tikz","summary":"Learning Objectives:\n What is LaTeX?
